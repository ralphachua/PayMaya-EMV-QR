## Data Objects

### Format Conventions

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Numeric (N) | Values that can be represented by all digits, from "0" to "9". |
| Alphanumeric Special (ans) | Values that can be represented by the Common Character Set as defined in [EMV Book 4]. The Alphanumeric Special alphabet includes ninety-six (96) characters in total and includes the numeric alphabet and punctuation. |
| String (S) | Values represented by any precomposed character(s) defined in [Unicode] |

### Representation

When referencing characters to include in the EMV Merchant-Presented QR Code, this specification encloses the characters in double quotes, for instance `"Test@123"`.

A character can be represented by its hexadecimal value. Single quotes are used to indicate the hexadecimal value for instance `'42'` to represent the character `"B"`.

### Encoding

For conversion of a character to its binary representation, this specification uses UTF-8 encoding as defined by [Unicode]. A character in UTF-8 can be up to 4 bytes long. Precomposed characters are recommended to maintain consistent character length for cross-platform compatibility reasons. For more information, please see:

*   [http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html](http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html)
*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character)

Characters from the numeric (N) and the Alphanumeric Special alphabet (ans), are always 1 byte long. For instance, `"3"` and `"c"` are encoded as '33' and '63' respectively. Unicode characters outside this range are encoded in multiple bytes, for example, `"ĉ"` is encoded as '0109' and `"的"` is encoded as 'E79A84'.

# Overview to EMV QR Code Payment

An EMV Merchant-Presented QR code payment transaction enables consumers to make purchases using a merchant generated and displayed QR Code based on the merchant's details. For example, it can be used for a transfer of funds to a Merchant account designated by the Merchant Account Information over a payment network in exchange for goods and services provided by the Merchant.

Consumers are issued a mobile application that has the capability to scan an EMV Merchant-Presented QR Code and initiate a payment transaction. This mobile application may be an existing mobile banking app offered by the Issuer or a third party. In both cases, the request to process the payment transaction is ultimately directed to the Issuer managing the account from which the funds will be withdrawn.

The issuer receives the initial payment transaction, and secures or withdraws the transaction amount from the consumer's account.

Upon receiving the payment transaction, the Acquirer checks the validity of the Merchant Account Information and other merchant credentials and, when valid, credits the payment transaction amount to the account associated with the Merchant Account Information.

The Merchant awaits the notification of a successful transaction response before delivering the goods and services to the Consumer.

The Issuer also provides a notification to the Consumer (typically to their mobile application).

## Merchant-Presented Mode Transaction Flow

![Image of Merchant-Presented Mode Transaction Flow](https://i.imgur.com/jMaHg9L.jpg)

[1] Merchant generates and displays QR Code based on merchant details.
[2] Consumer scans QR Code using a mobile application to initiate the transaction, with CDCVM if required.
[3] Mobile application sends the transaction initiation request to the Network.
[4] The Network processes the transaction and informs the Merchant and the Consumer of the transaction outcome.

# Data Organization

The data contained within a QR Code is organized as follows. Each data object is made up of three individual fields. The first field is an identifier (ID) by which the data object can be reference. The next field is a length field that explicitly indicates the number of characters included in the third field: the value field. A data object is then represented as an ID / Length / Value combination, where:

*   The ID is coded as a two-digit numeric value, when a value ranging from `"00"` to `"99"`,
*   The length is coded as a two-digit numeric value, with a value ranging from "01" to "99",
*   The value field has a minimum length of one character and maximum length of 99 characters.

In the QR Code, the data objects are organized in a tree-like structure, under the root. A data object may be a primitive data object or a template. A template may include other templates and primitive data objects.

*   Root
    *   Primitive data object
    *   Template
        *   Primitive data object
        *   Template

A data object that is not encapsulated within a template is said to be under the root of the QR Code.

The value of an ID is not unique and the data object to which it refers is context specific. If the ID is not under the root, the context of an ID defined by the encapsulating template.

As an example: ID `"01"` that is under the root of the QR Code refers to the Point of Initiation Method, while ID `"01"` refers to the Bill Number when it is under the Additional Data Field Template (that is, within ID `"62"`)

*   Root
    *   Payload Format Indicator (ID `"00"`)
    *   Point of Initiation Method (ID `"01"`)
    *   Merchant Account Information (ID `"26"`)
        *   Global Unique Identifier (ID `"00"`)
    *   BancNet Instapay P2P (ID `"27"`)
        *   Payment System Unique Identifier (ID `"00"`)
        *   Acquirer Identifier (ID `"01"`)
        *   Payment Type (ID `"02"`)
        *   Merchant Identifier (ID `"03"`)
        *   Merchant Credit Account (ID `"04"`)
        *   Mobile Number (ID `"05"`)
    *   Merchant Category Code (ID `"52"`)
    *   Transaction Currency (ID `"53"`)
    *   Transaction Amount (ID `"54"`)
    *   Country Code (ID `"58"`)
    *   Merchant Name (ID `"59"`)
    *   Merchant City (ID `"60"`)
    *   Additional Data Field Template (ID `"62"`)
        *   Bill Number (ID `"01"`)
        *   Bill Details Template (ID `"50"`)
            *   Global Unique Identifier (ID `"00"`)
            *   Biller Slug (ID `"01"`)
    *   BayadCenter Template (ID `"80"`)
        *   Global Unique Identifier (ID `"00"`)
        *   Biller Code (ID `"01"`)
        *   Service Code (ID `"02"`)
    *   CRC (ID `"63"`)

The Payload Format Indicator (ID `"00"`) is the first data object under the root and allows the mobile application to determine the data representation of the remaining data included in the QR Code and how to parse the data. The CRC ID (ID `"63"`) is the last object under the root and allows the mobile application to check the integrity of the data scanned without having to parse all of the data objects. The position of all other data objects under the root or within templates is arbitrary and may appear in any order.

The format of a value field in a data object is either Numeric (N), Alphanumeric Special (ans), or String (S). Note that Numeric is a subset of Alphanumeric Special and that Alphanumeric Special is a subset of String.

# Data Object ID Allocation

An ID of a primitive data object or a template is either allocated by EMVCo, Reserved for Future Use (RFU) by EMVCo, RFU by PayMaya, RFU by BayadCenter, or Unreserved.

IDs allocated by EMVCo have a meaning, representation, and format as defined by EMVCo in this, and related, specifications.

Unreserved IDs can be allocated and used by other parties, such as (domestic) payment systems and value-added service providers for their own products. These entities can then define the meaning and representation of the values within these data objects in one of the formats defined by this specification. Other constraints defined in this specification (for example, length of data objects) also apply.

These parties are encouraged though to use the EMVCo allocated data objects whenever the meaning of a data object corresponds to what is needed for their own solution, even if the representation or format is different from their existing or desired solution. The conversion from the representation and format as defined for the QR Code to the desired representation and format for the mobile application, user display, and subsequent transaction processing can be done by the mobile application. Avoiding duplication of information due to differences in representation and format reduces the payload data and therefore the size of the QR Code and improves the consumer experience when reading and processing the QR Code.

An example is given below:

> The QR Code presents the Transaction Amount (ID `"54"`) as a series of digits, where the `"."` character is used as a decimal mark to separate the decimals from the integer value. It also includes the Transaction Currency (ID `"53"`) using 3-digit numeric representation.

> The mobile application can easily represent the amount and the currency as defined for Amount, Authorized (Numeric) and Transaction Currency Code in [EMV Book 4].

> For example, if the values of the Transaction Amount and Transaction Currency in the QR Code are `"98.73"` and `"608"`, respectively, then the mobile application can convert these values to '000000009873' and '0608' to put them in the representation and format as used for the Amount, Authorized (Numeric) and Transaction Currency Code.

# Requirements

## Payload Length

> The length of the payload should not exceed 512 alphanumeric characters, and the number of characters should be reduced proportionally when multi-byte [Unicode] characters are used.

> Note that, as data object values with a format of S may contain characters coded as UTF-8 and depending on the alphabet being used there may not be a one-to-one mapping of characters to bytes, special consideration would be needed to determine the number of bytes in the payload.

## Position of Data Objects

*   The Payload Format Indicator (ID `"00"`) shall be the first data object in the QR Code.
*   The CRC (ID `"63"`) shall be the last data object in the QR Code.

    _All other data objects under the root may be placed at any position._

    _Data objects within a template, such as the Additional Data Field Template (ID `"62"`) or the Merchant Information—Language Template (ID `"64"`), may be placed in any position under their respective templates._

## Payload Format Indicator (ID `"00"`)

*   The Payload Format Indicator shall contain a value of "01". All other values are RFU.

## Point of Initiation Method (ID `"01"`)

*   If present, the Point of Initiation Method shall contain a value of `"11"` or `"12"`. All other values are RFU.

    _The value of `"11"` should be used when the same QR Code is shown for more than one transaction and the value of `"12"` should be used when a new QR Code is shown for each transaction._

## Transaction Currency (ID `"53"`)

*   The Transaction Currency shall conform to [ISO 4217] and shall contain the numeric representation of the currency. For example, PHP is represented by the value of `"608"`.

    _The value should indicate the transaction currency in which the merchant transacts._

## Transaction Amount (ID `"54"`)

*   If present, the Transaction Amount shall be different from zero, shall only include (numeric) digits `"0"` to `"9"` and may contain a single `"."` character as the decimal mark. When the amount includes decimals, the `"."` character shall be used to separate the decimals from the integer value and the `"."` character may be present even if there are no decimals.

    _The number of digits after the decimal mark should align with the currency exponent associated to the currency code defined in [ISO 4217]._

    _The above describes the only acceptable format for the Transaction Amount. It cannot contain any other characters (for instance, no space character can be used to separate thousands)._

    _The following are examples of valid Transaction Amounts: `"98.73"`, `"98"` and `"98."`._

    _The following are **NOT** valid Transaction Amounts: "98,73" and "3 705"._

*   The Transaction Amount shall not be included if the mobile application should prompt the consumer to enter the amount to be to the Merchant.

## Tip or Convenience Fee Indicator (ID `"55"`)

*   If present, the Tip or Convenience Indicator shall contain a value of `"01"`, `"02"`, or `"03"`. All other values are RFU.
    *   A value of `"01"` shall be used if the mobile application should prompt the consumer to enter a tip to be paid to the merchant.
    *   A value of `"02"` shall be used to indicate inclusion of the data object Value of Convenience Fee Fixed (ID `"56"`).
    *   A value of `"03"` shall be used to indicate inclusion of the data object Value of Convenience Fee Percentage (ID `"57"`).

## Value of Convenience Fee Fixed (ID `"56"`)

*   The Value of Convenience Fee Fixed shall be present and different from zero if the data object Tip or Convenience Indicator (ID `"55"`) is present with a value of `"02"`. Otherwise this data object shall be absent.

*   If present, the Value of Convenience Fee Fixed shall only include (numeric) digits `"0"` to `"9"` and may contain a single `"."` character as the decimal mark.

*   When the Value of the Convenience Fee Fixed includes decimals, the `"."` character shall be used to separate the decimals from the integer value.

    _The `"."` character may be present even if there are no decimals._

    _The number of digits after the decimal mark should align with the currency exponent associated to the currency code defined in [ISO 4217]._

    _The above describes the only acceptable format for the Value of Convenience Fee Fixed. It cannot contain any other characters (for instance, no space character can be used to separate thousands)._

## Value of Convenience Fee Percentage (ID `"57"`)

*   The Value of Convenience Fee Percentage shall be present if the data object Tip or Convenience Indicator (ID `"55"`) is present with a value of `"03"` and only values between `"00.01"` and `"99.99"` shall be used. Otherwise this data object shall be absent.

*   If present, the Value of Convenience Fee Percentage shall only include (numeric) digits `"0"` to `"9"` and may contain a single `"."` character as the decimal mark.

*   When the Value of the Convenience Fee Percentage includes decimals, the `"."` character shall be used to separate the decimals from the integer value and the `"."` character may be present even if there are no decimals.

    _The Value of Convenience Fee Percentage shall not contain any other characters._

    _For example, the "%" character must not be included._

    _The above describes the only acceptable format for the Value of Convenience Fee Percentage._

## CRC (ID "63")

*   The checksum shall be calculated according to [ISO/IEC 13239] using the polynomial '1021' (hex) and initial value 'FFFF' (hex). The data over which the checksum is calculated shall cover all data objects, including their ID, Length and Value, to be included in the QR Code, in their respective order, as well as the ID and Length of the CRC itself (but excluding its Value).

*   Following the calculation of the checksum, the resulting 2-byte hexadecimal value shall be encoded as a 4-character Alphanumeric Special value by converting each nibble to an Alphanumeric Special character.

*   _Example: a CRC with a two-byte hexadecimal value of '007B' is included in the QR Code as "6304007B"._
